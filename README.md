 # ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
 
A deep learning-based image classification project to identify plant diseases from leaf images.
Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify plant health status.
Aims to support smart agriculture by enabling automated and early disease detection.

# ðŸ§  Motivation:

Manual disease detection is time-consuming and error-prone.
Early identification of plant diseases helps prevent crop loss and increase productivity.
AI can provide cost-effective and scalable disease monitoring for farmers.
